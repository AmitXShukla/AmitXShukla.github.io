There are a dozen ETL/ELT and Data warehouse/ Data lake solutions available in the market today. All of them are extremely capable of extraction, load and transforming almost any type of data structure like structured, un-structured, binary, BLOB, sound, image or simple text in large quantities.","category":"page"},{"location":"elt/","page":"ELT vs ETL","title":"ELT vs ETL","text":"This package neither challenges or aims to build anything different. . Instead, this package will use existing RDBMS, DataLakes, or Document databases available in the market.","category":"page"},{"location":"elt/","page":"ELT vs ETL","title":"ELT vs ETL","text":"This package should be seen as providing a DataType environment, where we can first understand and define subject data structure, then do ELT operations on it.

This simple concept will age your data to fine gold and SME enjoy back seat ride on driverless AI.","category":"page"},{"location":"elt/","page":"ELT vs ETL","title":"ELT vs ETL","text":"Another example is,  Instead of loading all your accounting data into RDBMS tables, developers take time to pre-define an accounting Data Structure such as JOURNALS, LEDGER, ACCOUNTINGLINES, CHARTFIELDs and HIERARCHY data types, then ELTdata into these Data Structures and push it to the reporting database. This will lead to a much powerful driverless self-service live reporting/ predictive analytics environment.","category":"page"},{"location":"elt/","page":"ELT vs ETL","title":"ELT vs ETL","text":"In the following chapters, we will build ELT strategies.","category":"page"},{"location":"elt/#Extract","page":"ELT vs ETL","title":"Extract","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"elt/#Load","page":"ELT vs ETL","title":"Load","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"elt/#Transform","page":"ELT vs ETL","title":"Transform","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"elt/","page":"ELT vs ETL","title":"ELT vs ETL","text":"Let's get started.","category":"page"},{"location":"ds/#Data-Science-Operations","page":"Data Science Operations","title":"Data Science Operations","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"ds/","page":"Data Science Operations","title":"Data Science Operations","text":"Taxes are monetary charges collected by governments to fund building, maintaining and growth local and federal community infrastructure.
