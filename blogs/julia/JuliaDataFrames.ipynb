    "**Background:** Most of Enterprise grade ERP providers like SAP, Oracle, Microsoft build HCM, Finance, Supply Chain, CRM like systems, which store data in highly structured RDBMS tables.\n",
    "Recent advancements in ERP systems also support authoring non-structured data like digital invoices, receipt or handheld OCR readers.\n",
    "\n",
    "All of these ERP systems are great OLTP systems, but depend on Analytic systems for creating dashboards, ad-hoc analysis, operational reporting or live predictive analytics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Further, ERP systems depend on ELT/ELT or 3rd party tools for data mining, analysis and visualizations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, While data engineers use Java, Scala, SPARK based big data solutions to move data, they depend on 3rd party BI Reporting tools for creating dashboards, use Data Mining tools for data cleansing and AI Languages for advance predictive analytics.\n",

    "When I started learning more about Julia Language, I thought of using Julia Language to solve ERP Analytics multiple languages problem.\n",
    "Why not just use Julia Language to move, clean massive data set as Big data reporting solution, as Julia support multi-threading, distributing parallel computing.\n",
    "Julia language and associated packages has first class support for large arrays, which can be used for data analysis.\n",
